1. Important skill gaps to focus on:
- Advanced knowledge of statistical analysis and data mining techniques
- Experience with data visualization tools such as Tableau or Qlik Sense
- Understanding of machine learning algorithms and their applications
- Familiarity with big data technologies like Hadoop or Spark
- Ability to effectively communicate insights and recommendations to non-technical stakeholders

2. Personalized learning path:
- For advanced statistical analysis and data mining, I recommend taking the course "Statistical Learning" on Coursera, taught by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani from Stanford University.
- To gain experience with data visualization tools, Udemy offers a course called "Tableau 2020 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training For Data Science!" which covers all the basics and is highly rated by students.
- For understanding machine learning algorithms, I suggest taking "Machine Learning" on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng from Stanford University.
- To become familiar with big data technologies, edX offers a course called "Introduction to Big Data" from the University of California, San Diego.
- To improve communication skills, I recommend the course "Data Science Communication" on edX, taught by Rafael Irizarry from Harvard University.

3. Realistic timeline:
- Depending on the individual's current level of knowledge and time commitment, this learning path could take anywhere from 6 months to a year to complete.
- I suggest setting a goal to complete one course every 1-2 months, while also practicing and applying the skills learned in each course to real-world projects.
- It may also be beneficial to attend workshops or conferences related to data science and network with professionals in the field to gain practical experience and insights.
